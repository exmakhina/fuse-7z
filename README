= ABOUT =

fuse-7z is a FUSE file system that deals with 7z archives.

At the moment, the design is in progress, see WIP.
The current draft is based on lib7zip, but it may change.

See the FUSE documentation for details.

= WIP =

Currently, the code is in a proof of concept stage.
The current design contains a filesystem tree where all the nodes contain their full path.
This is not optimal but seems OK for the moment.
All the properties of all the files in the archive are read at initialization (so it can take some time to be done).

Only reads are planned at the moment, writes will come later, if they come.
I have no idea on how to perform optimal writes on big archives, and I don't know any real (sane) use case of writing in archives.
