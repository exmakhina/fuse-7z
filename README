= ABOUT =

fuse-7z is a FUSE file system that uses the p7zip library to access:
 - 7z archives
 - all archive formats supported by 7-zip !!!

At the moment, the design is in progress, see NOTES.
The current draft is based on lib7zip, but it may change.

fuse-7z is licensed under the GNU GPL v3.

= USAGE =

{{{
$ mkdir -p ~/mnt/zip
$ fuse-zip foobar.zip ~/mnt/zip
(do something with the mounted file system)
$ fusermount -u ~/mnt/zip
}}}

See the FUSE documentation for details.

= NOTES =

Currently, the code is in a proof of concept stage.
This is not optimal but seems OK for the moment, to read archives.
All the properties of all the files in the archive are read at initialization.
But it happens to be quite fast.

Only reads are planned at the moment, as the lib7zip library only supports them.
Writes will come later, if they come : I have no idea on how to perform optimal writes on big archives,
 and I don't know any real (sane) use case of writing in archives.
